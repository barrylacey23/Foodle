# Foodle

The aim of this project is to create a recipe application for android. Users can create an account where they can enter details about themselves (e.g. allergies, foods they don't like). The app will then generate approx. 6 recipes each day for the user to choose from, they can view the ingredients of the recipe as well as cooking instructions and choose to either like or dislike it, if they like a recipe it is saved into their recipe book, if they dislike a recipe it will never be shown to them again. A share feature may also be implemented to allow users to share a recipe with their friends/social media. There will also be an option to display nearby restaurants (could show the location on google maps) that make the meals for when users don't feel like cooking themselves.
